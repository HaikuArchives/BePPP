This is an experimental PPtP client. To the best of my knowledge, it does not work, although this may have more to do with my ineptitude in setting up a pptp daemon on my linux box than anything else. However, some instructions for trying it follow:
	To compile:
		-run build.sh from the Terminal. This will build the add-on and move it to its proper location.
	To setup:
		-Add a section like this to your network settings file :
interface1:
	DEVICECONFIG = pptp
	DEVICELINK = 
	DEVICETYPE = ETHERNET
	IPADDRESS = 192.168.0.3
	NETMASK = 255.255.255.0
	PRETTYNAME = PPtP
	ENABLED = 1
	DHCP = 0

		-Add pptp to the PROTOCOLS line in the same file
		-Add interface1 to the INTERFACES line
		-Turn on IP forwarding (absolute requirement)
		-Follow the directions for setting up PPPoE in DUN, except you must enter the server name or IP address of the pptp server as the phone number.
		-Restart networking
		-Check that all your modifications to the net settings file have not been changed

Notes:
	Network will say that PPtP is not present. It is. Network lies.
	Please e-mail at NathanWhitehorn@kagi.com with the contents of the file /tmp/pptp.dump and a description of how far it got.

Good luck!
