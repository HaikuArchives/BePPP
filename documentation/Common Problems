PROBLEMS - PPPoE

1. The net_server says that it can't initialize the PPPoE protocol.
	Check that the pppoe add-on is in /boot/home/config/add-ons/net_server. If it still doesn't work, try moving it to /boot/beos/system/add-ons/net_server.

2. I can connect but it keeps telling me that the host cannot be found!
	You may need to manually enter your DNS settings. Try to find these out from either a PPPoE client on another computer or from your ISP. Enter them in DialUpNetworking Settings.

3. It connects, but then disconnects quickly
	Choose "Static IP" in DialUpNetworking. You do not need to enter a static IP, DUN will use a dynamic IP anyway. If this doesn't fix it, please double-click the pppoe binary as though you were configuring it and choose "Force Manual DNS". This fixes a bug in DUN at the price of requiring manual entry of DNS settings.
